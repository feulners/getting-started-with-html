<p><b>How the Web Works</b></p> 
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. 
When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends 
a <em>HTTP Request to a server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML 
document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> 
interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<p><b>HTML</b></p>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form 
the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> 
which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".

<p><b>Tags and Elements</b></p>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell 
browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.

>This video</a> explain the distinction well. </p>
<p><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b></p>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This 
makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause 
huge problems in a program.</p>
<p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form 
an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. </p>
